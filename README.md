A small project to quickly **try** out new **hair colors**. I just couldn't resist after two friends of mine talked about their childhood sins ;). 

Interactive **demo** at [gurki.github.io/stylist/](gurki.github.io/stylist/).

ToDo
===
What's up with that performance? Use webgl and shaders instead!
